## Agenda
- Motivation
- What is Shiny
- Hello World App
- Showcase App
- Task
- Wrap up 

## Motivation for Shiny Apps 
- R is awesome
- number one statistical language 
- great community
- Shiny is a way to share & visualize code and results
- R was very local and static before
- browser world is exploding: let's take advantage of it

## What is Shiny
- interactive web application
- 'wrapper' for HTML and Javascript
- not general purpose: it's for data analysis 
- no HTML or Javascript knowledge needed
- but if you have some: you can use it to adapt your apps
- share results with community

## Prerequisites
- R installed
- RStudio installed


## Hello World and Showcase App
DEMO

## Share your code/app with colleagues
- downloadHandler()
- markup knitR

## Source of Material for today:
https://github.com/s4rify/ShinyAppTutorial

- here, you will find scripts and these slides with the exercises
- (I will upload everything there after today, if you ever want to downlad the rest :) 

## Exercises (1)
- write a Star Wars app which displays text like in the beginning of the movies:
![Alt text](starWarsTextSmall.png) 

## Exercise (2)
- download map.R, helpers.R and counties.rds from the github page
- install missing packages:
```{r , eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("maps", "mapproj"))
```
- create folder '/data' and put the counties.rds file inside 
- put helper.R in top-level folder on the same level with map.R
- run the app 
 
- explore the counties dataset
```{r , eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
counties <- readRDS("data/counties.rds")
```
- add the missing group of the population in a color of your choice to the app 

## Exercise (3)
- do we need another exercise? 
- show tutorials

## Wrap up
- I hope you got a feeling of what shiny apps can be used for 
- and you know where to find the material if you ever want to make one
- there are great tutorials out there 
- and some pretty nice showcases
- Shiny server

THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION! ʘ‿ʘ
